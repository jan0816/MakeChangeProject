## MAKE CHANGE PROJECT


### Overview:
This application allows a user to utilize a **cash register** by calculating the price of the item, the amount paid and what kind of currency (*coins and monetary bill types*) needs to be given back from cashier to client. It would serve helpful in small businesses and/or one person operations. 



### Technologies Used:

-Java

-Eclipse

### Lessons Learned:
- **PARAMETERS**: I learned how to call a variable from a main method and use it as a parameter in another method.
- **RETURNS**: I learned how to use other types of method variables (other than main) i.e. String method and have it return the value elsewhere.


### Problems/Resolutions:
- Getting the clients to be able to see plural forms of certain types of coins when getting their change back. 
- Resolved by: Declaring another *if* statement to distinguish between penny and pennies.
